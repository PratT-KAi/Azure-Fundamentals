## Cloud Concepts

Cloud is a collection of computers (mostly, physical servers) that are connected over the internet and are used to provide on-demand resources or services.

Thousands of physical servers are housed in buildings known as Data Centres. Microsoft, an American Multinational corporation has Data centres in more than 130 countries all over the globe. Through these data centres, Microsoft provides the Azure Cloud Computing service.

Azure offers resources and services for building, testing, deploying and managing applications.

Azure fundamentals is a six-part series that teaches you basic cloud concepts, provides a streamlined overview of many Azure services, and guides you with hands-on exercises to deploy your very first services for free.

After completing this learning path, you'll be able to:

1. Understand the benefits of cloud computing in Azure and how it can save you time and money
2. Explain cloud concepts such as high availability, scalability, elasticity, agility, and disaster recovery
3. Describe core Azure architecture components such as subscriptions, management groups, resources and resource groups
4. Summarize geographic distribution concepts such as Azure regions, region pairs, and availability zones


###  Common Cloud Services

Microsoft sorts Azure cloud services into nearly two dozen categories, including:

#### Compute 

These services enable a user to deploy and manage VMs, containers and batch jobs, as well as support remote application access. Compute resources created within the Azure cloud can be configured with either public IP addresses or private IP addresses, depending on whether the resource needs to be accessible to the outside world.

#### Mobile

These products help developers build cloud applications for mobile devices, providing notification services, support for back-end tasks, tools for building application program interfaces (APIs) and the ability to couple geospatial context with data.

#### Web

These services support the development and deployment of web applications. They also offer features for search, content delivery, API management, notification and reporting.

#### Storage

This category of services provides scalable cloud storage for structured and unstructured data. It also supports big data projects, persistent storage and archival storage.

#### Analytics

These services provide distributed analytics and storage, as well as features for real-time analytics, big data analytics, data lakes, machine learning (ML), business intelligence (BI), internet of things (IoT) data streams and data warehousing.

#### Networking

This group includes virtual networks, dedicated connections and gateways, as well as services for traffic management and diagnostics, load balancing, DNS hosting and network protection against distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks.

#### Media and content delivery network (CDN)

These CDN services include on-demand streaming, digital rights protection, encoding and media playback and indexing.

#### Integration

These are services for server backup, site recovery and connecting private and public clouds.

#### Identity

These offerings ensure only authorized users can access Azure services and help protect encryption keys and other sensitive information in the cloud. Services include support for Azure Active Directory and multifactor authentication (MFA).

#### Internet of things

These services help users capture, monitor and analyze IoT data from sensors and other devices. Services include notifications, analytics, monitoring and support for coding and execution.

#### DevOps

This group provides project and collaboration tools, such as Azure DevOps -- formerly Visual Studio Team Services -- that facilitate DevOps software development processes. It also offers features for application diagnostics, DevOps tool integrations and test labs for build tests and experimentation.

#### Development

These services help application developers share code, test applications and track potential issues. Azure supports a range of application programming languages, including JavaScript, Python, .NET and Node.js. Tools in this category also include support for Azure DevOps, software development kits (SDKs) and blockchain.

#### Security

These products provide capabilities to identify and respond to cloud security threats, as well as manage encryption keys and other sensitive assets.

#### Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning

This is a wide range of services that a developer can use to infuse artificial intelligence, machine learning and cognitive computing capabilities into applications and data sets.

#### Containers

These services help an enterprise create, register, orchestrate and manage huge volumes of containers in the Azure cloud, using common platforms such as Docker and Kubernetes.

#### Databases

This category includes Database as a Service (DBaaS) offerings for SQL and NoSQL, as well as other database instances -- such as Azure Cosmos DB and Azure Database for PostgreSQL. It also includes Azure SQL Data Warehouse support, caching and hybrid database integration and migration features. Azure SQL is the platform's flagship database service. It is a relational database that provides SQL functionality without the need for deploying a SQL server.

#### Migration 

This suite of tools helps an organization estimate workload Migration costs and perform the actual migration of workloads from local data centers to the Azure cloud.

#### Management and governance

These services provide a range of backup, recovery, compliance, automation, scheduling and monitoring tools that can help a cloud administrator manage an Azure deployment.

#### Mixed reality

These services are designed to help developers create content for the Windows Mixed Reality environment.

#### Blockchain

The Azure Blockchain Service allows you to join a blockchain consortium or to create your own.

#### Intune

Microsoft Intune can be used to enroll user devices, thereby making it possible to push security policies and mobile apps to those devices. Mobile apps can be deployed either to groups of users or to a collection of devices. Intune also provides tools for tracking which apps are being used. A remote wipe feature allows the organization's data to be securely removed from devices without removing a user's mobile apps in the process.

There are three basic types of cloud services: 


The first is Saas, which stands for Software as a Service. This would be a software application that you could access over the cloud without having to have it installed on your device.

PaaS stands for Platform as a Service. A service provider delivers a platform to you, enabling you to develop, run, and manage business applications over the cloud.

Finally, Iaas, or Infrastructure as a Service is infrastructure delivered over the internet. This would be the actual data storage – instead of maintaining servers and physical data centres, you can access all your data seamlessly though the cloud.



#### Software as a Service (SaaS)

A variety of services are available as Software as a Service, including file storage, backup, web-based email and project management tools. Using one of these applications, users can access, share, store and secure information in the cloud. SaaS cloud solutions examples include Dropbox, Slack and Microsoft 365.



#### Platform as a Service (PaaS)

Platform as a service is an environment in the cloud where developers can build and deploy apps. PaaS provides the database and operating system that is needed to develop cloud-based software. Developers can focus on their task, without needing to build and maintain the infrastructure that such software development processes normally require. AWS Elastic Beanstalk and Windows Azure are two cloud technology examples of PaaS.



#### Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)

Infrastructure as a service provides the infrastructure that you need to manage SaaS tools, including servers, storage, and networking resources. The cloud provider would manage the storage servers and networking hardware and may also offer additional services like load balancing and firewalls.

Common SaaS services include Dropbox, Salesforce, Cisco WebEx. PaaS services include Google App Engine, Apache Stratos and OpenShift. Some well-known IaaS services are Amazon Web Services (AWS), Cisco Metapod and Microsoft Azure. Many of these cloud computing service examples are already familiar to us all.


## What is Microsoft and Azure

Microsoft Azure, formerly known as Windows Azure, is Microsoft's public cloud computing platform. It provides a range of cloud services, including compute, analytics, storage and networking. Users can pick and choose from these services to develop and scale new applications, or run existing applications in the public cloud.

The Azure platform aims to help businesses manage challenges and meet their organizational goals. It offers tools that support all industries -- including e-commerce, finance and a variety of Fortune 500 companies -- and is compatible with open source technologies. This provides users with the flexibility to use their preferred tools and technologies. In addition, Azure offers 4 different forms of cloud computing: infrastructure as a service (IaaS), platform as a service (PaaS), software as a service (SaaS) and serverless.

Microsoft charges for Azure on a pay-as-you-go basis, meaning subscribers receive a bill each month that only charges them for the specific resources they have used.

## Types of Cloud Computing

#### Public Cloud

If you use the public cloud model, you have all your hardware rented from Azure. It helps you cut costs and you can scale out your IT resources based on demand. You don’t have to worry about maintaining your data centre or hardware, but you have limited control over your resources because you don’t own anything and you have to depend on Microsoft for the security of your hardware or applications.

#### Private Cloud

Also known as On-Premises Data centre. It is entirely dedicated to a single company. The company owns and maintains its private cloud. Resources can be used without the internet and the company has full control over everything. On the flip side, Capital expenses are huge.

#### Hybrid Cloud

Most companies use the hybrid cloud strategy. It is a combination of the public cloud(like Azure) and the private cloud.
The hybrid cloud model allows enterprises to deploy applications in private IT environments or public clouds and move between them. You can use the best features of a public cloud provider while storing sensitive information in your own data centres. This gives a business greater flexibility and more data deployment and security options.
For a hybrid cloud to work, the data in your on-premises data centre must be compatible with the cloud providers. The downside of using a hybrid cloud is the complexity that arises when connecting servers of public cloud with private cloud’s.


## Types of Cloud Computing Responsibilities




![responsibilities-of-cloud-service-models-2-1-1024x953.png](attachment:responsibilities-of-cloud-service-models-2-1-1024x953.png)







## Cloud Deployment Models

Once you have selected your chosen cloud service(s) you have the option of three main cloud computing deployment models: public cloud, private cloud, and hybrid cloud.


## CAPEX vs OPEX

Capital expenditures (CAPEX) are major purchases a company makes that are designed to be used over the long term. Operating expenses (OPEX) are the day-to-day expenses a company incurs to keep its business operational.


## Cloud Architecture Terminologies

This includes following:

1. Availablity
2. Scalability
3. Elasticity
4. Fault Tolerence
5. Disaster Recovery/Durability

## Evolution of Compute

### Dedicated Servers

A dedicated server, or computing server, is a machine that allocates all of its hardware resources to the user. Unlike a virtual server, which allocates a portion of the resources to virtualisation technology, a dedicated server offers you all of its RAM, storage, and computing power. This technology can be applied to cloud computing, while dedicated servers are referred to as ‘bare-metal’. This type of solution emphasises the physical availability of the server’s hardware resources, in contrast to services based on virtual instances.There are two main factors that make a dedicated server different from a cloud instance. Firstly, the machine's raw performance is different: there is no virtualisation layer consuming resources on a dedicated server, so you are guaranteed full use of the physical resources. The second difference concerns the level of server administration. With a dedicated server, you manage everything from its configuration to the data hosted on it, and you are also responsible for ensuring that it is secure. This means you can opt for a more advanced installation, which is essential for the use of certain business applications (for example). The main benefit of a dedicated solution is the total freedom you get as an administrator. 


### Virtual Machines

Virtual machines (VMs) are a technology for building virtualized computing environments. They have been around for quite a while and are considered the foundation of the first generation of cloud computing.

Simply put, a virtual machine is an emulation of a physical computer. VMs enable teams to run what appear to be multiple machines, with multiple operating systems, on a single computer. VMs interact with physical computers by using lightweight software layers called hypervisors. Hypervisors can separate VMs from one another and allocate processors, memory, and storage among them.

VMs are also known as virtual servers, virtual server instances and virtual private servers.

### Containers

Containers are a lighter-weight, more agile way of handling virtualization — since they don't use a hypervisor, you can enjoy faster resource provisioning and speedier availability of new applications. 

Rather than spinning up an entire virtual machine, containerization packages together everything needed to run a single application or microservice (along with runtime libraries they need to run). The container includes all the code, its dependencies and even the operating system itself. This enables applications to run almost anywhere — a desktop computer, a traditional IT infrastructure or the cloud.

Containers use a form of operating system (OS) virtualization. Put simply, they leverage features of the host operating system to isolate processes and control the processes’ access to CPUs, memory and desk space.

Containers have been around for decades, but the common consensus is that the modern container era began in 2013 with the introduction of Docker, an open source platform for building, deploying and managing containerized applications.

### Functions

If you would like to simplify application development model where your application architecture has microservices that are more granular, such that various functionalities are reduced typically to a single function then, Azure functions can be considered for usage.

In case, the solution needs some extension to existing azure application with event trigger based use cases , the azure functions can be better choice . Here, the specific code (function) shall be invoked only for specific event or trigger as per requirement and the function instances are created and destroyed on demand (compute on demand - function as a service (FaaS) ).

More often, the event driven architecture is seen in IoT where typically you can define a specific trigger that causes execution of Azure function. Accordingly, Azure functions have its place in IoT ecosystem as well.

If the solution has fast bursting and scaling requirement, then container Instances can be used whereas if the requirement is predictable scaling then, VMs can be used.

Azure function avoids allocation of extra resources (VMs) and also the cost is considered only when the function is processing work. Here, we need not take care of infrastructure such as where the code is going to execute, server configuration, memory etc. For ACI, the cost is per-second where it is accounted based on the time the container runs - CaaS(Container As A Service).

ACI enables for quickly spawning a container for performing the operation and deletion of it when done where the cost is only for few hours of usage rather than a dedicated VM which would be of high cost. ACI enables one to run a container by avoiding dependency on orchestrators like Kubernetes in scenarios where we would not need orchestration functions like service discovery, mesh and co-ordination features.

The key difference is that, in case of Azure function, the function is the unit of work whereas in container instance, the entire container contains the unit of work. So, Azure functions start and end based on event triggers whereas the microservices in containers shall get executed the entire time.

The processing / execution time also plays a critical role where if the event handler function consumes processing time of 10 minutes or more to execute, it is better to host in VM because the maximum timeout that is configurable for functions is 10 minutes.

## Global Infrastructure

Azure global infrastrcuture specific terms are like:

1. Datacenters
2. Regions
3. Region Pairs
4. Availability Zones and
5. Geographies

![what%20are%20azure%20datacenters.png](attachment:what%20are%20azure%20datacenters.png)

### Datacenters

An Azure data center is a unique physical building that contains thousands of physical servers with it's own power, cooling and networking infrastructure. These data ceneters are located all over the globe. As of this course recording, there are over 160+ Azure datacenters. These dataceneters are organised into Azure Regions.

### What is an Azure Geography

An Azure geography is an area of the world that contains one or more Azure Regions. For example, India, United States, United Kingdom are a few examples of Azure Geographies.

### Why are azure geographies important

For two reasons: First, let's say all of your customers are in India. You don't want to host your application somewhere in the United States. You don't want every request and the associated data travelling around the world. This causes unnecessary latency, delay and hence, poor performance. You want your application and data to be hosted as geographically close to your customer base as possible. Since all our customers are in India, we want to make sure, our application and data is hosted in India. One way Azure ensures this is by using geographies. 

Another reason is compliance with regulations. regulated data like financial, health care or credit card data may not be allowed to leave the country. Legally your organisation may be required to store such data in the same country where the operations are being carried out. Again, azure ensures this, by using geographies.

### What is an Azure Region
Simply put, an Azure Region is a set of Datacenters that are connected through a dedicated low-latency network. How many datacenters does a region contain. Well, we do not have a fixed number. It varies. There are regions of different sizes. A Region could be made up of just 1 dataceneter or multiple datacenters. The point is, an Azure Region is a group of one or more Azure Datacenters. As of this course recording, Azure has 58 regions worldwide.

You have the flexibility to deploy your applications and data to any Azure region you want. You can even deploy across multiple regions to deliver cross-region resiliency.

### What is cross-region resiliency

Well, in general, resilience is the ability of a software to react to problems in one of its components and still provide the best possible service.
Both your software and the underlying infrastructure must be resilient. If there is a problem, the end user should not know about it. The request must be handled and processed by another region. The end user should get the same level of service.

We can get this resiliency, by deploying our application and data in at least 2 regions. In this example we have our application and data deployed in two regions - Region A and Region B. 

### What is an Azure Availability Zone

An Azure Availability Zone is a unique physical location within an Azure region. Each Availability Zone is made up of one or more datacenters with independent power, cooling, and networking. Not all Regions have Availability Zones. Regions that support Availability Zones have a minimum of three separate zones to ensure resiliency.

If one of the Availability Zones has gone down for some reason, we still have our applications and data available from the rest of the two Availability Zones. There is a physical separation between each Availability Zone and it is this separation that protects our applications and data from Datacenter failures. With Availability Zones, Azure offers industry best 99.99% VM uptime SLA.

### Azure fault domain and update domain

An Availability Zone is a combination of a fault domain and an update domain. For example, if you create three VMs across three zones in an Azure region, your VMs are effectively distributed across three fault domains and three update domains. 

For some reason, if there is a power failure or power surge, equipment failure or some other fault in Availability Zone 1, only Availability Zone 1 is affected. As the availability zones are physically separted from each other, faults from one availability zone are not spread to the other availability zones. Since, in this example, we have 3 availability zones, it's like we have 3 separate fault domains. If there is a fault and Availability Zone 1 is down, we still have our VM available from the rest of the two fault domians i.e Availability Zones 2 and 3.
Similarly, if there is an update or a patch to be applied, azure schedules these at different times for different availability zones. So this means, we have just one of the availability zones affected while the update is being applied. The rest of the 2 zones are unaffected. 

In our example, since we have 3 availability zones, the updates will be applied at 3 different times. So even, if the VM from Availability Zone 1 is down, due to the update being applied, we have the rest of the 2 VMs still up and running i.e the VMs in Availability Zones 2 and 3.

### Azure Zonal services and Zone-redundant services

If you want to make the best use of availability zones and build high-availability systems, you will have to identify your compute, storage, networking, and data resources within an availability zone and replicate them in the other availability zones. Azure services that support Availability Zones are classified into two categories:

### Zonal services

Virtual machine is an example of a zonal service. A zonal service is pinned to a specific availability zone. This means it is only available in the availability zone where it is created. It is not automaically replicated to other availability zones. So, if want to build highly-available systems, identify zonal services, such as a VM for example and replicate them in other availability zones. Other examples of zonal services are managed disks and Standard IP addresses. 

### Zone-redundant services

Azure SQL Database is an example of zone-redundant service. These zone-redundant services are automatically replicated by the Azure platform across all availability zones. Unlike Zonal services, we don't have to replicate them manually.



### What are Azure paired regions

Azure regional pair, paired regions, or region pair, all these terms are used interchangeably and they refer to the same thing, i.e a pair of azure regions. So in simple terms, a regional pair consists of two regions within the same geography. 
As you can see from the image, at the highest level we have an Azure Geography. As we have already discussed, an Azure geography is an area of the world that contains one or more Azure Regions. For example, India, United States, Europe, Asia Pacific are a few examples of Azure Geographies. 

An azure region is made up of one or more datacenters. If availability zones are enabled, an azure region contains a minimum of three availability zones. An Availability Zone is made up of one or more datacenters. So the point is, an Azure region contains one or more datacenters or 3 or more availability zones if enabled.
Most regions in a geography are paired to ensure business continuity and disaster recovery (BCDR). The following are a few examples of azure paired regions. For the complete list of Azure paired regions, please check out the Microsoft official docs.
A regional pair consists of two regions within the same geography. However, there is one exception to this. Brazil South region is paired with South Central US region, which obviously, is outside of Brazil's geography.

### Benefits of paired regions

1. Physical separation between datacenters :

When possible, there is at least 300 miles of separation between datacenters in a regional pair, although this isn't practical or possible in all geographies. Physical datacenter separation reduces the likelihood of natural disasters, civil unrest, power outages, or physical network outages affecting both the regions at the sametime. So for whatever reason, if one of the regions is down, we still have the other region available.

2. Region recovery in the event of an outage : 

If for whatever reason, several regions world-wide are down, azure prioritizes recovery of one region out of every pair. So if you want your apps and data to be highly available, deploy them in paired regions. With this setup, if both the regions are down, azure prioritizes to recover at least one region from the pair, so we have our apps and data available again soon. If applications are deployed across regions that are not paired, recovery might be delayed, in the worst case the chosen regions may be the last two to be recovered.

3. Automatic Platform-provided replication : 

Some services such as Geo-Redundant Storage provides automatic replication to the paired region. This is a great benefit. In an event, where one of the regions go down, you still have the data available from the other region in the region pair.

4. Data residency, compliance and legal requirements :

With the exception of Brazil South, regions with in a region pair are from the same geography. This helps us meet data residency, compliance and legal requirements.
Sequential system updates : From time to time, patches and software updates need to be applied. Regions in a region pair are never updated simultaneously at the same time. They are always applied sequentially. This reduces the downtime to a great extent. If the planned update contains any bugs or logical errors, only one region is affected. Our apps and data will still be available from the other region in the region pair.

## Technology Overview

Computing Services means all information technology and computer systems (including Software, application service provider services, hosted computing services, information technology and telecommunication hardware and other equipment) relating to the transmission, storage, maintenance, organization, presentation, generation, processing or analysis of data and information whether or not in electronic format.

Storage as a service (STaaS) is a data storage business model where a provider rents storage resources to a customer through a subscription. STaaS saves you money through operating expenditure (OpEx) agility—you only pay for the storage you need, when you need it.

Database Services ensures that customer databases are protected and monitored by establishing backup and recovery procedures, providing a secure database environment, and monitoring database performance.

Database software support for Oracle and Microsoft SQL Server is available for any release currently supported by the database vendor or installed in the AITS environment. Both Oracle and SQL Server DBMS are fully supported by the DBA team. Oracle RDBMS is covered by our University site license; SQL Server may require licensing fees depending on the service footprint.

Services provided with the standard database support package include:

Initial database software installation, including configuration and verification as required
Performance of daily or weekly backups to disk, as requested by customer
Management and monitoring of disk space
Database restoration, as needed
Rebuilding of database indexes, as required
A primary on-call DBA to respond to alerts and customer issues as defined by the level of customer support


Other service options available, depending on database software, include but are not limited to:

Standby databases to support business continuity
Replication
Database cloning for development environments
Data conversion/migration assistance
Database query tuning
Database upgrades/patching
Database security maintenance

Application integration is the process of enabling independently designed applications to work together. Commonly required capabilities include: Keeping separate copies of data (in independently designed applications) consistent.

### Azure Resource Manager ARM

Azure Resource Manager (ARM) is the native platform for infrastructure as code (IaC) in Azure. It enables you to centralize the management, deployment, and security of Azure resources. ARM groups resources into containers that group Azure assets together. You can use ARM to deploy assets from multiple Azure resource provider services, such as Microsoft Storage and Microsoft Compute.Azure Resource Manager ARM is an Azure service you can use to manage and deploy resources using an infrastructure as code paradigm. It enables you to provision, modify, and delete resources using a variety of features including access controls, tags, and locks.When using Azure Resource Manager, there is some specific terminology you should be aware of. The most common terms include:resource—an asset that can be managed. Assets include virtual machines (VMs), virtual networks, databases, web apps, and storage accounts. Resources may also refer to tags, subscriptions, resource groups, or management groups.resource group—a container that groups together related resources. An Azure resource group enables you to manage multiple resources as a whole.resource provider—an individual service in Azure that you can create resources in. For example, Microsoft Storage or Microsoft Compute.Resource Manager template—a file that defines how resources should be deployed to groups, subscriptions or tenants. This file is defined in JavaScript Object Notation (JSON).declarative syntax—the syntax used for Resource Manager templates. It enables you to define how resources should be handled without having to know programming commands.

### Vnets and Subnets

Virtual network and subnets

A subnet is a range of IP addresses in the virtual network. You can divide a virtual network into multiple subnets for organization and security. Each NIC in a VM is connected to one subnet in one virtual network. NICs connected to subnets (same or different) within a virtual network can communicate with each other without any extra configuration.

When you set up a virtual network, you specify the topology, including the available address spaces and subnets. Select address ranges that don't overlap if the virtual network is connected to other virtual networks or on-premises networks. The IP addresses are private and can't be accessed from the Internet. Azure treats any address range as part of the private virtual network IP address space. The address range is only reachable within the virtual network, within interconnected virtual networks, and from your on-premises location.

If you work within an organization in which someone else is responsible for the internal networks, talk to that person before selecting your address space. Ensure there's no overlap in the address space. Communicate to them the space you want to use so they don't try to use the same range of IP addresses.

There aren't security boundaries by default between subnets. Virtual machines in each of these subnets can communicate. If your deployment requires security boundaries, use Network Security Groups (NSGs), which control the traffic flow to and from subnets and to and from VMs.

###  Cloud Native Networking Services

Cloud-native principles and technology have proven to be an effective acceleration technology in building and continuously operating the largest clouds in the world. This new technology has been selected by Cisco and others in the industry to develop next-generation Virtual Network Functions (VNFs) called Cloud-Native Network Functions (CNFs). These CNFs, when running inside telecommunications premises, form a private cloud, and the same public cloud principles can be effectively used. CNFs cover all branches of the service provider market, including cable, mobile, video, security, and network infrastructure.

Virtualization and VNFs helped us in getting started in moving toward cloud-native applications. Virtualization, when done properly, offered software models with increased flexibility with hardware dependencies eliminated. However, there are limitations in that VNFs upgrades are slow, restarts take a long time, CLI is still the main interface, software was typically a lift and shift operation, hypervisors such as OpenStack were hard to install, there was little elasticity, and scaling was problematic.

Cloud-native applications address these limitations. Cloud-native applications in general have these characteristics:

Developed using microservices architecture (that is, 12-factor apps)
Managed by Kubernetes-style orchestration
Built-in microservice discovery mechanisms
Supports dynamic elasticity and scale
Resilient services
Improved feature velocity
Smaller footprint with fast restart
Continuous deployment and automation principles
Consistent lifecycle management across containers
Modern health and status telemetry

### Enterprise Hybrid Networking Services
Hybrid network services enable enterprises in designing, deploying and managing networks by leveraging best-in-breed technology and solutions interconnecting different network segments including campus, datacenters, branch and public cloud in a flexible, cost-effective manner. Our network solutions are geared towards converting business intent into connectivity requirements that can be realized using physical and virtual networks as necessary to deliver a highly abstracted, intent-driven network that can easily scale vertically in function and horizontally in scale. 
 
### Azure Traffic Manager
Traffic Manager includes a range of traffic-routing methods that allow you to control how Traffic Manager chooses which endpoint should receive traffic from each end user. For more information, see Traffic Manager traffic-routing methods.

Each Traffic Manager profile specifies a single traffic-routing method. However, there are scenarios that require more sophisticated traffic routing than the routing provided by a single Traffic Manager profile. You can nest Traffic Manager profiles to combine the benefits of more than one traffic-routing method. Nested profiles allow you to override the default Traffic Manager behavior to support larger and more complex application deployments.

### Azure DNS
Azure DNS is a hosting service for DNS domains that provides name resolution by using Microsoft Azure infrastructure. By hosting your domains in Azure, you can manage your DNS records by using the same credentials, APIs, tools, and billing as your other Azure services.

Reliability and performance

DNS domains in Azure DNS are hosted on Azure's global network of DNS name servers. Azure DNS uses anycast networking. Each DNS query is answered by the closest available DNS server to provide fast performance and high availability for your domain.

Security

Azure DNS is based on Azure Resource Manager, which provides features such as:
Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC) to control who has access to specific actions for your organization.
Activity logs to monitor how a user in your organization modified a resource or to find an error when troubleshooting.
Resource locking to lock a subscription, resource group, or resource. Locking prevents other users in your organization from accidentally deleting or modifying critical resources.

DNSSEC

Azure DNS does not currently support DNSSEC. In most cases, you can reduce the need for DNSSEC by consistently using HTTPS/TLS in your applications. If DNSSEC is a critical requirement for your DNS zones, you can host these zones with third-party DNS hosting providers.

Ease of use

Azure DNS can manage DNS records for your Azure services and provide DNS for your external resources as well. Azure DNS is integrated in the Azure portal and uses the same credentials, support contract, and billing as your other Azure services.
DNS billing is based on the number of DNS zones hosted in Azure and on the number of DNS queries received.
Your domains and records can be managed by using the Azure portal, Azure PowerShell cmdlets, and the cross-platform Azure CLI. Applications that require automated DNS management can integrate with the service by using the REST API and SDKs.

Customizable virtual networks with private domains

Azure DNS also supports private DNS domains. This feature allows you to use your own custom domain names in your private virtual networks rather than the Azure-provided names available today.

Alias records

Azure DNS supports alias record sets. You can use an alias record set to refer to an Azure resource, such as an Azure public IP address, an Azure Traffic Manager profile, or an Azure Content Delivery Network (CDN) endpoint. If the IP address of the underlying resource changes, the alias record set seamlessly updates itself during DNS resolution. The alias record set points to the service instance, and the service instance is associated with an IP address.
Also, you can now point your apex or naked domain to a Traffic Manager profile or CDN endpoint using an alias record. An example is contoso.com.

### Azure Load Balancer
Load balancing refers to evenly distributing load (incoming network traffic) across a group of backend resources or servers.

Azure Load Balancer operates at layer 4 of the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model. It's the single point of contact for clients. Load balancer distributes inbound flows that arrive at the load balancer's front end to backend pool instances. These flows are according to configured load-balancing rules and health probes. The backend pool instances can be Azure Virtual Machines or instances in a virtual machine scale set.

A public load balancer can provide outbound connections for virtual machines (VMs) inside your virtual network. These connections are accomplished by translating their private IP addresses to public IP addresses. Public Load Balancers are used to load balance internet traffic to your VMs.

An internal (or private) load balancer is used where private IPs are needed at the frontend only. Internal load balancers are used to load balance traffic inside a virtual network. A load balancer frontend can be accessed from an on-premises network in a hybrid scenario.

### Scale Sets
Scale sets are built from virtual machines. With scale sets, the management and automation layers are provided to run and scale your applications. You could instead manually create and manage individual VMs, or integrate existing tools to build a similar level of automation

### Internet of Things (IoT) services
Internet of Things (IoT) services represents a set of end-to-end services in which businesses contract with external providers to design, build, install and operate IoT solutions, including advisory consulting for IoT planning.

### Serverless Services

Serverless computing is a cloud computing execution model in which the cloud provider allocates machine resources on demand, taking care of the servers on behalf of their customers. "Serverless" is a misnomer in the sense that servers are still used by cloud service providers to execute code for developers

### Microsoft Security Development Lifecycle SDL

The Microsoft Security Development Lifecycle (Microsoft SDL) is a software development process based on the spiral model, which has been proposed by Microsoft to help developers create applications or software while reducing security issues, resolving security vulnerabilities and even reducing development and maintenance costs. The process is divided into seven phases: training, requirements, design, implementation, verification, release and response.

The training phase is essential because practice is considered a requirement for the implementation of SDL. Concepts found in this phase include secure design, threat modeling, secure coding, security testing and practices regarding privacy. The requirements phase, on the other hand, includes the establishment of security and privacy that end-users require. Creating good quality gates/bug bars, and performing security and privacy risk assessments is part of the second phase.

The third phase, design, considers security and privacy concerns, which helps decrease the risk of repercussions from the public. Attack surface analysis or reduction and the use of threat modeling will help apply an organized approach to dealing with threat scenarios during the design phase. Implementation of the design should employ approved tools and include the analysis of dynamic run-time performance to check an application’s functional limitations.

The release phase includes the final review of all the security activities that will help ensure the software’s security capacity. After the release phase comes the response phase to implement the incident response plan that was prepared during the release phase. This is crucial because it guards end-users from software vulnerabilities that can emerge and harm the software and/or the user.

### Azure Policies

An Azure Policy definition, created in Azure Policy, is a rule about specific security conditions that you want controlled. Built in definitions include things like controlling what type of resources can be deployed or enforcing the use of tags on all resources.

### Role Based Access Control RBAC

Role-based access control (RBAC) is a method of restricting network access based on the roles of individual users within an enterprise.

RBAC ensures employees access only information they need to do their jobs and prevents them from accessing information that doesn't pertain to them.

An employee's role in an organization determines the permissions that individual is granted and ensures lower-level employees can't access sensitive information or perform high-level tasks.

In the role-based access control data model, roles are based on several factors, including authorization, responsibility and job competency. As such, companies can designate whether a user is an end user, an administrator or a specialist user. In addition, access to computer resources can be limited to specific tasks, such as the ability to view, create or modify files.

Limiting network access is important for organizations that have many workers, employ contractors or permit access to third parties, like customers and vendors, which makes it difficult to monitor network access effectively. Companies that depend on RBAC are better able to secure their sensitive data and critical applications.

Benefits of RBAC
There are multiple benefits to using RBAC, including:

Improving operational efficiency. With RBAC, companies can decrease the need for paperwork and password changes when they hire new employees or switch the roles of existing employees. RBAC lets organizations quickly add and change roles, as well as implement them across platforms, operating systems (OSes) and applications. It also cuts down on the potential for error when assigning user permissions. Additionally, with RBAC, companies can more easily integrate third-party users into their networks by giving them predefined roles.
Enhancing compliance. Every organization must comply with local, state and federal regulations. Companies generally prefer to implement RBAC systems to meet the regulatory and statutory requirements for confidentiality and privacy because executives and IT departments can more effectively manage how the data is accessed and used. This is particularly important for financial institutions and healthcare companies that manage sensitive data.
Giving administrators increased visibility. RBAC gives network administrators and managers more visibility and oversight into the business, while also guaranteeing authorized users and guests on the system are only given access to what they need to do their jobs.
Reducing costs. By not allowing user access to certain processes and applications, companies may conserve or more cost-effectively use resources, such as network bandwidth, memory and storage.
Decreasing risk of breaches and data leakage. Implementing RBAC means restricting access to sensitive information, thus reducing the potential for data breaches or data leakage.

### Lock resources

As an administrator, you can lock a subscription, resource group, or resource to prevent other users in your organization from accidentally deleting or modifying critical resources. The lock overrides any permissions the user might have. You can set the lock level to CanNotDelete or ReadOnly.

### Management Groups

Management groups are containers that help you manage access, policy, and compliance across multiple subscriptions. Create these containers to build an effective and efficient hierarchy that can be used with Azure Policy and Azure Role Based Access Controls.

## Billing and Pricing

### Service Level Agreements

The Azure Service Level Agreement (SLA) describes Microsoft's commitments for uptime and connectivity for individual Azure Services. Each Azure service has its own SLA with associated terms, limitations and service credits. Some (free) services don't have an SLA, for example Azure DevTest Labs.

### Service Credits

Service credits (or service level credits) are a mechanism by which amounts are deducted from the amounts to be paid under the contract to the supplier if actual supplier performance fails to meet the performance standards set in the service levels.

### Composite SLAs

Composite SLAs involve multiple services supporting an application, each with differing levels of availability. For example, consider an App Service web app that writes to Azure SQL Database. At the time of publication, these Azure services have the following SLAs: App Service web apps = 99.95% SQL Database = 99.99%.

### TCO Calculator
